# jCheetah

jCheetah is a jQuery plugin that allows you to use custom HTML attributes to perform certain actions described by modules, it's extensible so as to allow you to write your own.

It's primary objective is to increase readibility and reduce javascript, which also could impact develop times.

Also includes client side templating (module ajax) and a mysql udf to get data directly in JSON/CSV format (not required by jCheetah itself but optional), which objective is to create JSON/CSV models which will then be parsed by the ajax module.

jCheetah is developed and mantained by [Edward Gonz√°lez](mailto:eg@onzasystems.com), tips/advices are welcome.
