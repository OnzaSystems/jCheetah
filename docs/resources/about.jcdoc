@info The idea
@contents <div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-body"><h2>Author</h2><p>jCheetah is developed and mantained by Edward Gonz√°lez (Maracaibo, Venezuela)</p><h2>Story</h2><p>I was talking to my friend Matt (a Rails programmer) about a seriously small script I wrote that was supposed to perform ajax requests in a easy-to-code manner, he said that it may be a nice idea as javascript is always a pain for the developers who just want their jobs finished, as I was in a hurry to get some attention (at the time I am unemployed), I wrote this plugin which is expansible and easy to use, not a complex one, and doesn't really add new functionability, but enhances readibility and helps you code a lot faster</p><h2>To Consider:</h2><ul><li>jCheetah doesn't produce faster Websites, instead helps you create a website faster; however in a era where most computers/phones got a suitable processor this may not be an real problem, there have been many improvements in the API to increase speed, however always with the cost of module readibility and reduced error handling.</li><li>jCheetah is an one person product, so please report any bugs to <a href="mailto:eg@onzasystems.com">eg@onzasystems.com</a>.</li></ul></div></div>
